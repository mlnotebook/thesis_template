Tables are enclosed in a 'colorbox' which makes the background white against the 'mdframe' of the float object. Checks and crosses are created from custom commands that use dings: \texttt{\textbackslash cmark} and \texttt{\textbackslash xmark}.

Multiple tables can be stacked using minipages. Note the \texttt{[t]} in the minipages to keep them aligned at the top.
